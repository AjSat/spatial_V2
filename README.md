# PV Solver algorithm

Documentation coming soon by 21th Oct, 2022.

- Extends Featherstone's open-source (GPL3v license) and amazingly readable MATLAB code for rigid-body dynamics algorithms.

-  Integrated with CasADi. The dynamics expressions can be auto-differentiated and used in optimization-based algorithms.

- Apologies to users without a MATLAB license. In the future, we hope to present an implementation of our algorithms in Python/Julia.
